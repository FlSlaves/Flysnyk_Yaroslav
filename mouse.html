<p>A computer mouse (plural mice, sometimes mouses)[nb 1] is a hand-held pointing device that detects
     two-dimensional motion relative to a surface. This motion is typically translated into the motion
      of a pointer on a display, which allows a smooth control of the graphical user interface of a computer.</p>
